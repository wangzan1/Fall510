This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
summary(cars)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
```{r}
#1.(a)
1:20
#(b)
20:1
#part a and b are straightforward
#(c)
c(1:20,19:1)# create a vector which is the combination of 1:20 and 19:1
#d
assign("tmp",c(4,6,3))# The assignment named 'tmp' has 4,6,3 three elements. 
tmp
#e
rep(tmp,10)# use rep() function to repeat 'tmp' 10 times .
#f
c(rep(tmp,10),4) #similar rep() function for e, but need to add one more 4
#g
rep(tmp,times=c(10,20,30))
# Each elements in tmp needs to have  different repeating times, so I use 'times' to make 10 0occurrences of 4,20 occurrences of 6 and 30 occurrences of 3. 
#2.
x<-seq(3,6,by=.1)# First set up the x value to be a sequence from 3 to 6 with 0.1 difference.
exp(x)*cos(x)# Then write out the formula of the equation and put x value into the equation.
#3.
#a
(0.1^seq(3,36,by=3)*0.2^seq(1,34,by=3))#similar to problem 2, I just put the different  sequences into the formula.
#b
(2^(1:25))/(1:25)# The idea is the same as part a. And 1:25 is the same as seq(1,25),but it is easier to use 1:25. Therefore, I use 1:25 instead.
#4.
#a
i<-(10:100)# create a value i from 10 to 100
sum(i^3+4*i^2)# Put i into the formula and sum up the value the formula.
#b
i <- 1:25
sum(2^i/i+3^i/i^2)# Same process of part b,I just change the value of i and put into the different formula.
#5.
#a
paste("label",1:30)# Paste function works here. Paste 'lable' 30 times with number 1,2,...,30 after that. And it has one single space automatically, so I do not need to change .
#b
paste("fn",1:30,sep='')# The only thing that is different with part a is that I need to add sep='' so that there is no space between 'fn' and number. 
#6
set.seed(50)
xVec <- sample(0:999, 250, replace=TRUE)
yVec <- sample(0:999, 250, replace=TRUE)
#a
yVec[-1]-xVec[-250]# yVec[-1] means to delete the first one in yVec, so here I delete the first one of yVec and the last one of xVec. 
#b
sin(yVec[-250])/cos(xVec[-1])# Similar idea as part a,just change the formula
#c
xVec[c(-250,-249)]+2*xVec[c(-1,-250)]-xVec[c(-1,-2)]# Here I need to delete two values from xVec, so I use c( value1,value2 ) to delete two values from xVec. This also works for deleting muliple values.
#d
sum(exp(-xVec[-1])/(xVec[-250]+10))# Similar idea as above, plug into the formula. I just need to sum up the values of each vector.
#7
set.seed(50)
xVec <- sample(0:999, 250, replace=TRUE)
yVec <- sample(0:999, 250, replace=TRUE)
#a
yVec[yVec>600]# Add condition yVec>600 to find the values in yVec that larger than 600. Just need to pay attention for [], not()
#b
which(yVec>600)# 'Which' function can find the index of the value in yVec.
#c
xVec[which(yVec>600)]# After finding the index in part b, xVec[] can give the values corresponding to the indexes that are provided.
#d
sqrt(abs(xVec-mean(xVec)))# Here I just use sqrt,abs,mean to create the formula.
#e
sum( yVec>max(yVec)-200 )# yVec>max(yVec)-200 is a condition that find the values in yVec such that they are larger than the value of max(yVec)-200. Then add up all such values.
#f
sum(xVec%%2==0)#Find the value in xVec which mod 2 is 0.%% is for mod operator.Then sum up the values.
#g
xVec[order(yVec)] #Order function can retrun the index of  the increaing values.
#h
yVec[seq(1,250,by=3)]# seq(1,250,by=3 means the numbers 1,4,...,250. After getting the index, I can know the value in yVec.
#8
1+sum(cumprod(seq(2,38,by=2)/seq(3,39,by=2)))
#cumprod is to multiple from the first to the last. For example,cumprod(1:10),we get 1       2       6      24     120     720    5040   40320  362880 3628800.So after using cumprod, I get a seires of vectors and then I just need to sum up all of these values. Just do not forget to add 1 .
